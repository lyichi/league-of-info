                            Jinx lives to wreak havoc without a thought for the
                            consequences, leaving a trail of mayhem and panic in
                            her wake. A manic and impulsive criminal, she
                            despises nothing more than boredom, and gleefully
                            brings her own volatile brand of pandemonium to the
                            one place she finds dullest: Piltover. With an
                            arsenal of deadly toys, she unleashes the brightest
                            explosions and loudest blasts - all the better to
                            shock and surprise the hapless authorities. Always
                            just out of the law's reach, Jinx's favorite game is
                            to toy with Piltover's finest - especially Vi.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Piltover had long been known as the City of
                            Progress, a place where peace and order reigned.
                            That serenity was challenged when a new kind of
                            criminal arrived, the likes of whom had never been
                            seen. This mysterious outlaw unleashed a series of
                            warped and destructive capers that endangered the
                            entire city, and left its people reeling from the
                            worst crime spree in Piltover's history.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As the string of crimes without rhyme or reason hit
                            the city, sightings of the lawbreaker emerged.
                            Though the young woman's origins were a mystery,
                            some saw traces of Piltover hextech in her firearms,
                            while others described the street fashions of Zaun
                            in her dress. Because her arrival always brought
                            trouble with it, those who crossed her path soon
                            gave her a name: Jinx.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            As Jinx's rampage escalated, Caitlyn - the sheriff
                            of Piltover - responded by declaring a state of
                            emergency and organizing a city-wide manhunt. In
                            typical Jinx fashion, the criminal marked the
                            Piltover treasury, the city's most secure building,
                            with a direct challenge to its most abrasive
                            officer. With a caricature of Vi's face splashed
                            across the treasury's facade, and a scribbled time
                            and date of her supposed raid, Jinx was openly
                            daring the enforcer to stop her from robbing it.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Determined to put the troublemaker behind bars, Vi
                            watched and waited outside the treasury until Jinx's
                            time had finally come. True to her scrawled promise,
                            the smiling menace showed her face. Knowing this was
                            her chance to capture the outlaw, Vi gave chase into
                            the building's interior. She smashed through wall
                            after wall to chase down Jinx, who giggled as she
                            lit up the evacuated treasury with fiery explosions.
                            Vi finally cornered the criminal inside the vault,
                            but Jinx wasn't done just yet. With a maniacal
                            laugh, she fired a barrage of rockets, bringing the
                            entire building down upon them both.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            When Vi finally crawled out of the ruins, the
                            battered enforcer found no trace of Jinx. Adding
                            insult to injury, not a single ounce of gold had
                            been taken from the ruined vault. Instead, the
                            criminal left a parting message to her favorite
                            officer of the law - a challenge only now visible
                            through the gaping opening in Piltover's skyline.
                            The lights of the city spelled out a simple taunt:
                            you'll never catch me. As Vi read the message, she
                            heard the distant laughter of her new nemesis, and
                            the city plunged into utter darkness for the very
                            first time.
