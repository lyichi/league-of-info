                        <p>
                            On every wall of his den, the trophy hunter Rengar
                            mounts the heads, horns, claws, and fangs of the
                            most lethal creatures in Valoran. Though his
                            collection is extensive, he remains unsatisfied,
                            tirelessly seeking greater game. He takes time with
                            every kill, studying his prey, learning, and
                            preparing himself for the next encounter with the
                            one monster he never managed to defeat.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Rengar never knew his real parents, but was raised
                            by a human who was revered as a legendary hunter. He
                            was an ideal pupil, intently absorbing the lessons
                            of his father, and improving them with his uncanny
                            feral instincts. Before his mane had fully grown,
                            Rengar set off on his own and claimed a wide
                            territory for himself. Along its perimeter, he
                            mounted the skulls of his slain prey - a warning to
                            would-be aggressors. He thought undisputed reign of
                            a region would fulfill him, but instead, he grew
                            restless. No beasts in his domain proved challenging
                            prey, and without formidable adversaries to push his
                            limits, Rengar's spirit waned. He feared that no
                            worthwhile game remained, that he would never again
                            feel the thrill of the hunt. Just when things seemed
                            their bleakest, he encountered the monster. It was a
                            disturbing, alien thing, distinctly out of place in
                            his world. It bore huge scything claws and devoured
                            any animal that strayed across its path. Overzealous
                            at the prospect of a challenge, Rengar ambushed the
                            monster in haste. It far outclassed anything he'd
                            hunted before. Their fight was savage, and each
                            suffered crippling wounds. Rengar lost an eye, but
                            the most grievous blow was to his pride. He had
                            never before failed to make the kill. Worse yet, the
                            severity of his injuries forced him to retreat. Over
                            the following days, he hovered on the threshold
                            between life and death. He was wracked with pain,
                            but beneath it, he felt a glimmer of joy. The hunt
                            was on. If such powerful beings existed in the
                            world, he would find them, and stack their heads
                            high. The monster, however, was a kill he wanted to
                            savor. On his den's largest wall, he reserves a
                            space for the beast's head, a trophy he swears will
                            one day be the centerpiece of his collection.
